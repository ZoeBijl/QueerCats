# QueerCats

A collection of queer cat emoji. These are based on [this emoji from Google’s Noto font](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/bf295c4/svg/emoji_u1f610.svg). The Noto font was released by Google under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

### Credits

All flags were (re)created in SVG by myself. The one exception is the polyamory flag; which was sourced from Wikipedia.

Some notes on flags:

- All rainbow flags include the black and brown stripes; no I won’t change that
- We use the “sunset” lesbian flag as designed by [Emily Gwen](https://www.instagram.com/theemilygwen/) because trans rights are human rights and fuck transphobia
- Sapphic is based on Maya Kern’s revision of [Lydia’s design](https://medium.com/@lydiandragon/a-lesbian-flag-for-everyone-cef397b89459)

### Sub-sets

These sets don’t include cats but are all pride themed!

## Structure of project

- `/Fire` is where you’ll find the pride fire emoji set

- `/Flags` is where you’ll find the SVG-files used to make the emoji

- `/PNG` contains the exported PNG-files (128px)

- `/SVG` contains exported SVG-files

- `Queer Cats.fig` you can open this in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

- Deprecated: `Queer Cats.sketch` you can open this in [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)

If you don’t have access to Figma, you can also open the source materials in any other SVG editor.

## Source materials

In the SVG folder you’ll find a file named `Queer Cat.svg` this is the main body and face of the emoji. You can use the group with an ID of “Body” as a mask for any flag (or other image you want to put on a cat’s face). The file hasn’t been optimised—all the information needed to create folders/layers in an editor should be there.

## Optimisation

All SVG files should be optimised with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and manually checked for readability.
